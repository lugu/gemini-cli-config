PLAN.MD. Summarize the changes in CHANGE.md.

The work directory is generated with `mktemp -d -p . gemini.XXXX`. Use the most
recent one.

## Implementation phase Guidelines

Execute the plan outlined in `PLAN.MD`.

**Key Activities:**

-   Follow each step in `PLAN.MD` sequentially.
-   Act autonomously, iterating on steps as needed until complete.
-   Validate that each step is completed with a test.
-   If a task cannot be completed, document the cause in `FAILURE.MD`,
    explaining the blockers.

**Output:**

-   The implemented solution that has been verified.
-   A markdown file (`gemini.XXXX/CHANGE.MD`) summarizing the changes. This
    file is written in a way that it can be used to submit the change. It
    explains the problem and described how the change solve the problem. The
    first line of the file shall be a very concise description of the change
    (less than 120 characters) followed by an empty line.
