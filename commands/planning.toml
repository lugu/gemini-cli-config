description = "From DISCOVERY.md produce PLAN.md."

prompt = """

Read DISCOVERY.md, then prepare a detailed planning as described bellow and
generate PLAN.md.

The work directory is generated with `mktemp -d -p . gemini.XXXX`. Use the most
recent one.

## Phase 2: Planning

Based on the output of the discovery phase (`DISCOVERY.MD`), create a concrete
plan of action.

**Key Activities:**

-   **Analysis:** Given the solution described in `DISCOVERY.md`, identify
		subparts that can be delivered independantly (ex: tests, code, documentation).
-   **Task Breakdown:** Breakdown those deliverable into small tasks.
-   **Verifiability:** Ensure each task has a clear way to verify its
    completion.

-   **Testing:** Each task should be verified. If the task include a code
    change, a test should be written. Otherwise propose a way to verify that the
    task was successfully completed.
-   **Sequencing:** Order the tasks logically.
-   **Final Steps:** The plan must conclude with:
    -   A task to summarize the overall changes made.
    -   A task to create `CHANGE.md`, suitable for a commit
        message, explaining the problem and the implemented solution.

**Output:**

-   A markdown file (`PLAN.MD`) detailing the step-by-step plan.
-   If `DISCOVERY.md` is missing, return a warning.
